# Project Docs â€“ Canonical Sources

- Architecture: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- ADRs: `docs/adr/**` (e.g., `docs/adr/0002-interface-organization-principles.md`)
- API Spec: `docs/API_SPEC.md`
- AI Guidelines: `docs/CONTRIBUTING_AI.md`
- Testing: `apps/server/TESTING.md`
- ESLint Boundaries: `apps/server/eslint.config.js`
- Config (env schema): `apps/server/src/infra/config/index.ts`
- Server Bootstrap: `apps/server/src/app/bootstrap.ts`
- Routes & Plugins: `apps/server/src/app/**`

Notes
- This file must remain a pointer-only index; keep all authoritative content in the docs above.
- If guidance conflicts, prioritize `ARCHITECTURE.md` and relevant ADRs.

## Assistant Behavior (Required)

- Always follow the rules and patterns defined in the referenced documents. Treat them as the single source of truth.
- If a request or existing code conflicts with the docs (architecture, boundaries, DI, testing, security), immediately highlight the conflict and discuss before proceeding.
- Make decisions strictly based on the documented rules. Do not introduce new patterns that contradict the docs without explicit agreement.
- When something is ambiguous or underspecified, ask clarifying questions and reference the relevant doc sections.
