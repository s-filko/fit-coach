# Eval datasets

One JSONL file per dataset, one case per line, validated by `evals/schema/case.schema.ts`
(schema: `docs/PROMPT_EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md` §3).

## Case count

P0 ships **at least 10 cases per phase** (`LLM_CORE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` § P0 item 5) — enough
to record a `v0` baseline. `PROMPT_EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md` BR-EVAL-004's target of 30 per phase
(≥10 should-act, ≥10 should-not-act, ≥10 adversarial) is reached incrementally as later
refactor phases add cases. The gap is deliberate, not an unmet acceptance criterion.

## Rules

- BR-EVAL-001: a case is immutable once a baseline references it. Fix by adding a new case
  and setting `"deprecated": true` on the old one.
- BR-EVAL-002: every BUGS.md entry of class "LLM did the wrong thing" gets at least one case
  tagged with its id before it is marked Fixed.
- BR-EVAL-003: fixtures contain no real user data.
